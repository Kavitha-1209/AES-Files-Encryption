"""
AES File Encryption üîê
----------------------

This project lets you encrypt and decrypt files using AES (Fernet).

USAGE:
1. Generate a secret key (only once):
   >>> generate_key()

2. Encrypt a file:
   >>> encrypt_file("example.txt")

   This will create: example.txt.enc

3. Decrypt a file:
   >>> decrypt_file("example.txt.enc")

   This will create: example_decrypted

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
- Keep 'secret.key' safe. Without it, you cannot decrypt your files.
- Do NOT upload 'secret.key' to GitHub (it's ignored using .gitignore).
